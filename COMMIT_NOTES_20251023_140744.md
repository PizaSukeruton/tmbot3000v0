# TMBot3000 Member Selection Feature Implementation

## Date: October 23, 2025
## Status: Production Ready

### Major Features Added
- **Dynamic Member Selection System**: Complete event attendee assignment functionality
- **Separated API Architecture**: Tour members moved to dedicated `/api/tour-members` endpoint
- **CSV-Based Dynamic Data**: All member data pulled from tour_members.csv (no hardcoded values)

### Technical Implementation
#### Frontend Changes:
- Enhanced `showCreateEventForm()` with async tour member fetching
- Added 5 member selection buttons: All Touring Party, All Crew, All Artist, Custom, Clear All
- Implemented dynamic department filtering (crew = non-band departments)
- Custom selection interface with individual member checkboxes
- Real-time selection display showing selected member names
- Updated `submitCreateEvent()` to include assigned_members array

#### Backend Changes:
- **NEW FILE**: `./backend/routes/tourMembers.js` - Dedicated tour members API
- Added route mounting in server.js: `/api/tour-members`
- Removed tour-members route from events.js (separation of concerns)
- Fixed CSV parsing using `csv-parse/sync` with proper async file reading
- EventManager properly handles assigned_members as array or comma-separated string

#### Data Structure:
- **15 Tour Members**: 7 production, 1 sales, 1 transport, 1 general, 5 band
- **Dynamic Department Logic**: 
  - All Touring Party: All 15 members
  - All Crew: production + sales + transport + general (10 members)
  - All Artist: band department (5 members)
- **CSV Storage**: assigned_members stored as comma-separated member_id list

### Architectural Improvements
- **RESTful API Design**: `/api/tour-members` follows proper REST conventions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Tour members separate from events logic
- **No Hardcoded Data**: All selections based on dynamic CSV content
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if tour-members API fails

### Testing Results
- Member selection buttons functional with dynamic data
- Event creation successful with assigned_members integration
- Backend CSV storage working correctly
- Frontend-backend integration complete

### Development Methodology
- EOF-based file editing (no temp file corruption)
- Syntax validation at each step
- Best solution approach (not fastest)
- Backup creation before major changes
- Real data validation (no mock data)

### Next Phase Considerations
- Edit event functionality (placeholder implemented)
- Show integration with event calendar
- Advanced member filtering options
- Bulk event operations
