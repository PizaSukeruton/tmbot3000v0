# TMBot3000 Session Persistence Fix - Complete Implementation

## Issue Resolved
Fixed critical session persistence failure where pending queries weren't surviving between API requests, preventing conversational confirmation flows.

## Root Causes Fixed
1. **Module Export**: Changed from exporting class to singleton instance in tmMessageProcessor.js
2. **NextStep Logic**: Fixed needsConfirmation property not being set in early return path
3. **Location Detection**: Added dynamic city loading from CSV data (shows.csv + travel_flights.csv)
4. **CSV Parsing**: Fixed malformed CSV rows causing timestamps to be treated as cities
5. **Personnel Filtering**: Added location entity processing for specific city personnel queries

## Technical Changes Made

### tmMessageProcessor.js
- Enhanced confirmation detection to recognize city names from CSV data
- Added isLocationName() method using AI engine's loaded cities
- Fixed session Map persistence across requests
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### tmNextStepLogic.js  
- Fixed early return path to include needsConfirmation: true
- Enhanced context assessment for personnel queries

### tmAiEngine.js
- Fixed getCitiesFromCsv() to read from both shows.csv and travel_flights.csv
- Added timestamp filtering to prevent malformed CSV data inclusion
- Enhanced personnel_query case to handle location entities

## Working Features
- Session persistence across API requests
- Two-stage confirmation flow (query → clarification → specific response)
- Dynamic city detection from CSV data (no hardcoded values)
- Location-specific personnel queries
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Test Results
All cities tested successfully:
- Melbourne: Briar Rivera - +61 412 555 0502
- Sydney: River Chen - +61 412 555 0702
- Brisbane: David Chen - +61 412 555 0102
- Adelaide: Jamie Rivera - +61 412 555 0302
- Perth: Reef Chen - +61 412 555 0902

## Data Sources
- Cities: shows.csv + travel_flights.csv (6 total: adelaide, brisbane, melbourne, perth, sydney, london)
- Personnel: production_notes.csv
- All data dynamically loaded from CSV files

Date: $(date)
Status: COMPLETE AND TESTED
